# Title: Kalea's Traveling Heart

# Illustration Style: Dreamy Vintage Storybook

Overall Appearance:
The illustration exudes a nostalgic, heartwarming charm reminiscent of classic European storybooks. It combines a painterly realism with a touch of magical warmth, making the scene feel timeless, cozy, and emotionally rich.

Character Design:
Characters, including the little girl and the dog, are rendered with soft edges, rounded features, and subtle expressions that evoke innocence and wonder. The proportions are slightly stylized (childlike, with larger heads and gentle facial features) but grounded enough to feel real. Animals are friendly and expressive, with detailed fur textures and soulful eyes.

Color Palette:
Warm, muted tones dominate—think soft creams, sepia browns, dusty rose, and sage green. Hints of sunlight and natural wood hues are used to create a sun-drenched, homely atmosphere. Avoid saturated primaries; instead, lean into earthy, vintage colors that feel aged and cozy.

Linework:
Minimal visible linework. The image leans more into painterly strokes and blended shading rather than defined outlines. When lines are present, they're delicate and integrated into the color, serving to enhance form subtly.

Backgrounds:
Rich in detail but never cluttered. Backgrounds are storytelling elements themselves—windows with golden sunlight, wicker baskets, plush furniture, and scattered toys all contribute to the lived-in feel. Architectural elements like arched windows and textured brickwork add to the storybook realism.

Lighting:
Golden-hour lighting is key. Soft, natural light streams through the window, casting gentle rays and warm glows across the room. Light dust particles and subtle sparkles enhance the dreamy, magical quality of the scene. No harsh shadows; instead, soft diffusion keeps the tone gentle.

Texture:
Textural richness is vital—soft fabrics, shaggy rugs, wooden toys, and fur all have distinct, tactile qualities. The artwork mimics traditional media, like watercolor and colored pencils, layered with a digital polish that maintains a handmade feel.
