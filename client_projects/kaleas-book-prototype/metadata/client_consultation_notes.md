## 2. Story Concepts

### Concept 1

- **One-liner**: "Kalea's Moving Day Adventure" – A brave little girl learns to say goodbye to her old home while discovering exciting new possibilities in her family's red mobile home.
- **Brief Description**: Kalea loves her room and all her toys, but today is moving day. With the help of her dog and two cats, she learns to choose her most special items to take on their journey. As she counts and sorts her belongings (1 teddy, 2 books, 3 shirts), she discovers that memories stay with you even when you leave things behind. The story features a Pippi Longstocking book as one of her treasures and ends with Kalea excitedly spotting wildlife (a fox, deer, and wolf) from her new mobile home window as her adventure begins.
- **Connection to Child's Interests**: Incorporates her pets, favorite animals, counting, Pippi Longstocking reference, and addresses the theme of letting go while embracing new adventures.

### Concept 2

- **One-liner**: "Kalea's Bicycle Patience" – An eager little girl learns that some skills take time to master, with encouragement from forest animal friends.
- **Brief Description**: Kalea loves her new pink bicycle but gets frustrated when she can't ride it perfectly right away. During a family outing to a nature park, she meets a baby deer learning to walk, a fox kit learning to pounce, and a wolf pup learning to howl. Each animal shows Kalea that everyone needs practice and patience to learn new skills. With her animal friends' encouragement and by counting her attempts (1, 2, 3...), Kalea learns to enjoy the process of mastering her bicycle, celebrating small victories along the way.
- **Connection to Child's Interests**: Features her bicycle, favorite animals, counting, and the theme of patience while learning new skills.

### Concept 3

- **One-liner**: "A-B-C, What Does Kalea See?" – A curious girl explores her new traveling home and discovers alphabet letters in unexpected places.
- **Brief Description**: As Kalea's family prepares their red mobile home for their journey, she turns the packing and organizing into an alphabet adventure. She finds items beginning with different letters (A for apple, B for book about her favorite character Pippi, C for her cat) and counts how many of each she can spot. When feeling sad about leaving some toys behind, her pets show her how they're happy with just a few special things. The story ends with the family's first stop where they see a deer, fox, and wolf in the distance – Kalea realizes the whole world is waiting to be explored.
- **Connection to Child's Interests**: Incorporates alphabet learning, counting, her pets, favorite animals, Pippi reference, and addresses letting go while embracing new experiences.

### Concept 4

- **One-liner**: "Kalea Can't Wait!" – A story about an impatient little explorer who learns that good things come to those who wait.
- **Brief Description**: Kalea is so excited about swimming lessons, but she has to wait until the weekend. Each day, she practices patience differently: on Monday she counts to 10, on Tuesday she reads about her hero Pippi, on Wednesday she plays with her dog and cats, on Thursday she rides her bicycle, and on Friday she helps pack special items for their upcoming travels. Finally, Saturday arrives and she has her first swimming lesson! Her patience is rewarded with a special sighting of a fox, deer, and wolf family at the lake – all patiently teaching their babies to swim too.
- **Connection to Child's Interests**: Features swimming, counting, Pippi, her pets, favorite animals, and the themes of patience and preparing for change.

### Concept 5

- **One-liner**: "Kalea's Special Box" – A thoughtful story about a little girl choosing her most treasured possessions for a worldwide adventure.
- **Brief Description**: Kalea receives a special red box with her name and only ten things can fit inside for their mobile home journey. As she considers what to bring, her dog and two cats help her decide what's truly important. She selects items representing what she loves (a small Pippi doll, pictures of animals she hopes to see, her bicycle bell) and assigns each a number from 1-10, creating her own countdown of treasures. When she feels sad about leaving other things, her parents show her photographs of all the amazing places they'll visit, including forests with real wolves, foxes, and deer.
- **Connection to Child's Interests**: Addresses letting go of possessions, features counting, Pippi, her pets, favorite animals, and her favorite color (red box), while preparing her for the mobile home adventure.

## Page 1

"Today is a special day," said Mama, handing Kalea a bright red box with her name on it.

"What is it?" asked Kalea, her eyes wide with wonder.

## Page 2

"We're going on a big adventure in our new home on wheels," Papa explained. "This box is for your most special treasures."

Kalea peeked inside the empty box. "How many things can fit?"

"Ten things," said Mama, holding up all her fingers. "Let's count together: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10!"

## Page 3

Kalea looked around her room. So many toys! So many books! How could she choose just ten?

Her dog, Buddy, wagged his tail and brought her a ball.

"A is for Adventure," said Kalea, putting the ball in her box. "This will be treasure number 1."

## Page 4

Fluffy, her black cat, rubbed against a book.

"B is for Book about Pippi," said Kalea, adding her favorite story. "That's treasure number 2."

Shadow, her gray cat, purred from her bicycle bell.

"C is for Chiming bell," Kalea smiled, placing it in the box. "Treasure number 3."

## Page 5

Kalea felt sad looking at all the other toys. "I can't take everything," she sighed.

Buddy nuzzled her hand. He only needed his favorite ball to be happy.

"D is for Dog," said Kalea, adding a small photo of Buddy. "Treasure number 4."

## Page 6

"E is for Everywhere we'll go," said Kalea, carefully putting a small map in her box. "That's treasure number 5."

She looked at her teddy bear. It was too big for the box.

"F is for Friend," she said, choosing a tiny teddy instead. "Treasure number 6."

Kalea spotted her red swimming goggles.

"G is for Goggles," she declared. "I'm learning to swim! Treasure number 7."

Fluffy and Shadow watched as she packed.

"H is for Home," said Kalea, adding a drawing of her cats. "You're treasure number 8."

## Page 8

Kalea counted her treasures. "1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8... I need two more!"

Papa knocked on her door. "Would you like a special one from me?"

He handed her a small pink notebook.

"I is for Ideas," Kalea said. "I can draw the animals we see! Treasure number 9."

## Page 9

One space left. Kalea looked around her room one last time.

"J is for Journey," she decided, placing her small Pippi doll in the box. "Pippi has adventures too! Treasure number 10."

The box was full. A-B-C-D-E-F-G-H-I-J. And 1-2-3-4-5-6-7-8-9-10.

## Page 10

Kalea looked at the toys left behind. Some big, some small. She felt a little sad.

"We can take pictures of everything," Mama suggested. "Memories don't need boxes."

Kalea nodded. "K is for Keeping memories in my heart."

## Page 11

That night, Kalea helped pack her clothes in a pink suitcase.

"L is for Leaving soon," she said.

"M is for Mobile home," said Papa, showing her pictures of their new traveling house.

"N is for New places," added Mama.

Kalea smiled. "O is for Our adventure together!"

## Page 12

The next morning was moving day. Kalea clutched her special red box as they said goodbye to their home.

"P is for Patience," she said, remembering to wait calmly as the grown-ups loaded the mobile home.

Buddy, Fluffy, and Shadow had special travel beds inside.

## Page 13

"Q is for Quiet time," whispered Mama as they all settled in for their first journey.

Kalea watched out the window as houses and trees went by.

"R is for Ready," she said, hugging her box of treasures. "I'm ready for adventures!"

## Page 14

As their mobile home drove into the countryside, Kalea spotted something.

"S is for Stop! Look!" she exclaimed.

Papa slowed down. There by the forest edge stood a beautiful deer.

"T is for Two deer!" she counted, as a baby deer appeared beside its mother.

## Page 15

They drove a little further.

"U is for Up there!" Kalea pointed. A fox with a bushy tail watched them from a hill.

"V is for Very excited," she giggled. "I'm very, very excited!"

## Page 16

As the sun began to set, they parked their mobile home by a peaceful lake.

"W is for Wolf!" whispered Kalea, spotting a gray shape between distant trees.

"X is for Xcellent eyes you have," smiled Papa.

## Page 17

Kalea opened her special box and took out her notebook and pencil.

"Y is for Yellow moon," she said, looking up at the rising moon as she drew the animals she had seen.

Buddy curled up beside her. Fluffy and Shadow purred from their beds.

## Page 18

That night, as Kalea lay in her cozy new bed, she felt happy.

Her special box sat nearby with all ten treasures safe inside.

"Z is for Zzzzz," whispered Mama, kissing her goodnight.

Kalea smiled. She couldn't wait to see what tomorrow would bring.
